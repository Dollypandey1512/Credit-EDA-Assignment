**Author**: Dolly Pandey  
**Program**: IIIT Bangalore - EPGP Data Science  
**Topic**: Exploratory Data Analysis on Credit Data

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a credit dataset to:

- Identify key factors influencing loan payment difficulties
- Determine variables that are strong indicators of default
- Gain insights into demographic and financial trends among defaulters and non-defaulters
---
## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

Two datasets were used:

1. **Application Data** - Contains customer-level demographic and credit information
2. **Previous Application Data** - Historical loan application information

---
## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning

- Dropped columns with >30% missing values
- Dropped rows with >50% missing values
- Imputed missing values using:
  - **Mean** (numerical)
  - **Median** (numerical)
  - **Mode** (categorical)
- Converted `DAYS_BIRTH` into `AGE`
- Removed outliers (e.g., in `AMT_GOODS_PRICE`)

---

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Performed

### âœ… Univariate Analysis
- Analyzed target variable (`TARGET`)
- Studied impact of features like `Income`, `Education`, `Employment Type`, and `Credit Amount`

### âœ… Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
- Explored relationships between:
  - `Income` and `Credit Amount`
  - `Gender` and default rates
  - `Education` and `Income Group` on default status
- Merged current and previous loan data for extended analysis
- Identified correlation patterns between features (e.g., `AMT_CREDIT`, `AMT_GOODS_PRICE`, `AMT_ANNUITY`)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- **Working clients** and **lower-income groups** have higher default rates
- **Higher education** and **academic degree holders** have low default records
- **Repeated clients** have higher loan approval chances
- Features like `AMT_CREDIT` and `AMT_GOODS_PRICE` are highly correlated

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

- Banks should prioritize clients with strong credit history, higher income, and better educational background.
- Risk analysis models should weigh factors like employment type, previous loan status, and income group.
